JESUS FREAK

acoustic : 
 E-G-A-B (2x)
  INTRO: Fm-Ab-Eb-Bb-Cm (4x)     

VERSE 1:
Fm  Db           Bb
Separated, and I cut myself clean
       Fm            Db         Bb
From a past that comes back in my darkest of dreams.
Fm        Db          Bb
Been apprehended by a spiritual force,
      Fm           Db             Bb
And a grace that replaced all the me I divorced.

RAP 1:
        Fm                         Db
I saw a man with a tat(too) on his big fat belly,
   Bb
It wiggled around like marmalade jelly.
   Fm                 Db
It took me a while to catch what it said,
         Bb
'cause I had to match the rhytm of his belly with my head.
Fm               Db
"Jesus Saves" is what it raved,
     Bb
In a typical tatoo green.
   Fm                    Db
He stood on a box in the middle of the city
    Bb
And claimed he had a dream.

CHORUS:
F                Ab              Eb             Bb    Cm
What will people think when they hear that I, a Jesus Freak?
F                Ab           Eb       Bb   Cm
What will people do when they find out it's true?
F              Ab           Eb         Bb    Cm
I don't really care if they label me a Jesus Freak.
F              Ab    Eb   Bb  Cm
There ain't no disguising the truth.
Fm              Bb             Fm        Bb
(There ain,t no disguising the truth, no I ain,t in to hiding--the
truth)

VERSE 2:
Fm  Db       Bb
Kamikaze, my death is gain
          Fm           Db         Bb
I've been marked by my maker, a peculiar display
Fm           Db          Bb
The high and lofty, they see me as weak
         Fm             Db           Bb
'Cause I won't live and die, for the power they seek?

RAP 2:
            Fm                     Db
There was a man in the desert with naps in his head,
    Bb
The sand that he walked was also his bed.
    Fm                           Db
The words that he spoke made the people assume,
             Bb
There wasn't too much left in the upper room.
     Fm                    Db
With scabs on his back and hair on his face,
     Bb
They thought he was strange by the locust he ate.
           Fm                          Db
Ya see the Pharisees tripped when they heard him speak,
          Bb               
Until the King took the head of this Jesus Freak.

CHORUS

BRIDGE: Fm - Ab/F - Bb/F (2x)

Fm             Ab/F          Bb/F
People say I'm strange, does it make me a stranger,
        Fm       Ab/F   Bb/F      Fm
That my best friend was born in a manger
Fm             Ab/F          Bb/F
People say I'm strange, does it make me a stranger,
        Fm       Ab/F   Bb/F      Fm
That my best friend was born in a manger


Dm-Ab-Dm/Ab-Ab-Dm/Ab-Ab (2x)

CHORUS (2x)

Fm               Ab     Eb        Bb     Cm
What will people think (What will people think)
Fm               Ab  Eb        Bb     Cm
What will people do (What will people do)
Fm             Ab    Eb        Bb    Cm
I don't really care (What else can I say)
Fm                Ab          Eb     Bb       Cm  Fm
There ain't no disguising the truth (Jesus is the way)

WHAT IF I STUMBLE


Tom: F
		

Intro:
Dm-C-G

Dm                                C-G
What if I stumble? What if I fall?

Dm
Is this one for the people?
    C              G
Is this one for the Lord?
      Dm                    C            G
Or do I simply serenade for things I must afford?
        Dm                      C          G
You can jumble them together, my conflict still remains
       Dm                          C              G
For holiness is calling, in the midst of courting fame.

{Bridge}
Bb              F             C
Cause I see the trust in their eyes
(Though the sky is falling)
Bb              F             C
They need your love in their lives
(Compromise is calling)

{Chorus}
C               G        E
What if I stumble? What if I fall?
Am                                   F
What if I lose my step and I make fools of us all?
C                                 G                     E
Will the love continue when my walk becomes a crawl?
Am              F             Dm
What if I stumble, and what if I fall?

Dm
What if I stumble?  What if I fall?
C                  G
You never turn in the heat of it all.
Dm                              C-G
What if I stumble?  What if I fall?

Dm                           C               G
Father please forgive me for I can not compose
Dm                              C                  G
The fear that lives within me, or the rate at which it grows.
Dm                                C                     G
If struggle has a purpose on the narrow road you've carved
Dm                              C                 G
Why do I dread my trespasses will leave a deadly scar?

Bb               F             C
Do they see the fear in my eyes?
(Are they so revealing?)
Bb              F             C
This time I can not disguise
(All the doubt I'm feeling)

{Chorus}

C-G-E-Am-F (x4)

Dm                                                 C                G
Everyone's got to crawl when you know that your up against the wall
(It's about to fall)
Dm                                                 C                G
Everyone's got to crawl when you know that . . .
Dm                                                 C                G
Everyone's got to crawl when you know that your up against the wall
(It's about to fall)
Dm                                                 C                G
Everyone's got to crawl when you know that . . .

Bb              F       C
I hear you whispering my name,  you say
Bb              F             C
My love for you will never change, never change


{Chorus} x 2


Dm
What if I stumble?  What if I fall?
C                  G
You never turn in the heat of it all.
Dm
What if I stumble?  What if I fall?
C                  G
You are my comfort, and my God!

Dm
Is this one for the people?
C               G
Is this one for the Lord?
