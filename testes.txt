acoustic : 
 E-G-A-B (2x)
  INTRO: Fm-Ab-Eb-Bb-Cm (4x)     

VERSE 1:
Fm  Db           Bb
Separated, and I cut myself clean
       Fm            Db         Bb
From a past that comes back in my darkest of dreams.
Fm        Db          Bb
Been apprehended by a spiritual force,
      Fm           Db             Bb
And a grace that replaced all the me I divorced.

RAP 1:
        Fm                         Db
I saw a man with a tat(too) on his big fat belly,
   Bb
It wiggled around like marmalade jelly.
   Fm                 Db
It took me a while to catch what it said,
         Bb
'cause I had to match the rhytm of his belly with my head.
Fm               Db
"Jesus Saves" is what it raved,
     Bb
In a typical tatoo green.
   Fm                    Db
He stood on a box in the middle of the city
    Bb
And claimed he had a dream.

CHORUS:
F                Ab              Eb             Bb    Cm
What will people think when they hear that I, a Jesus Freak?
F                Ab           Eb       Bb   Cm
What will people do when they find out it's true?
F              Ab           Eb         Bb    Cm
I don't really care if they label me a Jesus Freak.
F              Ab    Eb   Bb  Cm
There ain't no disguising the truth.
Fm              Bb             Fm        Bb
(There ain,t no disguising the truth, no I ain,t in to hiding--the
truth)

VERSE 2:
Fm  Db       Bb
Kamikaze, my death is gain
          Fm           Db         Bb
I've been marked by my maker, a peculiar display
Fm           Db          Bb
The high and lofty, they see me as weak
         Fm             Db           Bb
'Cause I won't live and die, for the power they seek?

RAP 2:
            Fm                     Db
There was a man in the desert with naps in his head,
    Bb
The sand that he walked was also his bed.
    Fm                           Db
The words that he spoke made the people assume,
             Bb
There wasn't too much left in the upper room.
     Fm                    Db
With scabs on his back and hair on his face,
     Bb
They thought he was strange by the locust he ate.
           Fm                          Db
Ya see the Pharisees tripped when they heard him speak,
          Bb               
Until the King took the head of this Jesus Freak.

CHORUS

That my best friend was born in a manger

What will people do (What will people do)
